This directory contains scripts that implement hooking mhonarc onto 
mailman as an external archiver. The appropriate Mailman config
options are:

PUBLIC_EXTERNAL_ARCHIVER = '/home/admin/mhonarc/archive.pl --listname %(listname)s'
PRIVATE_EXTERNAL_ARCHIVER = '/home/admin/mhonarc/archive.pl --private --listname %(listname)s'

The html output can basically be divided into 4 levels
 
 - Overall master index
   (http://mail.gnome.org/archives/)
   Generated by update-master.pl

 - Per-list main indices
   (http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/index.html)
   Generated by archive.pl as messages come in, or can  
   be regenerated with makeidx.pl

 - Per-list per-month author/date/thread indices
   (http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/2002-November/thread.html)
   Generated by mhonarc as messages are archived or can
   be regenerated with editidx.pl

 - Messages
   (http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/2002-November/msg00024.html)
   Generated by mhonarc as messages as are archived

====
Files in this directory -

archive.pl - The main archiver; takes three options
   --listname  - the name of the list
   --private   - if specified, the list is a private list
   --makeindex - if specified, generate the main index for
                 $listname and exit

   Unless --makeindex is specified, accepts one or more
   messages on stdin and archives them into the appropriate
   monthly digest (web-archives/private/gtk-list/2002-November.txt.gz).

 The variables at top:

  $ARCHIVE_DIR = "/mail/list-archives/private";
  $PUBLIC_ARCHIVE_DIR = "/mail/list-archives/public";
  $PUBLIC_RCFILE = "/home/mailman/mhonarc/public-rc/base.rc";
  $PRIVATE_RCFILE = "/home/mailman/mhonarc/private-rc/base.rc";

 Define where things are archived and the mhonarc config files
 for archives.

editidx.pl - Remake month indices for one or more lists.

  Has two possible options
  
   --publiconly - only remake indices for public lists
   --privateonly - only remake indices for private lists

  If lists are specified on the command line, processes
  just those lists, otherwise all lists (subject to 
  --publiconly/privateonly)

  Has the same config variables at the top as archive.pl

makeidx.pl - Run 'archive.pl --makeidx' (regenerate the
  main index) on a given set of lists, specified as for 
  editidx.pl.

  Has the same config variables at the top as archive.pl

update-master.pl - Regenerate the overall master index

upgrade.sh - Script used when moving over from pipermail
 to mhonarc - basically goes through the old archives,
 and atomically feeds the contents of the .mbox files
 into archive.pl and and moves the archived messages to .mbox.old.
 into archive.pl. The point here was not to have to
 shutdown incoming messages while rearchiving old messages
 The procedure was something like:

  - Run upgrade.sh while mailman was live, get 99% of
    messages.
  - Shut down mailman
  - Run upgrade.sh to get messages that came in during
    the first pass.
  - Switch incoming messages to going into mhonarc
  - Turn mailman back on

find-unquoted.pl - utility script for fixes broken mbox files
fix-unquoted.pl  - utility script for fixes broken mbox files


Moving archives from a previous list host:
My memory is that what you want to do is:

A) Create the list
B) move #{LISTNAME}.mbox (the old archives in mbox format) to
 ~mailman/archives/private/#{LISTNAME}.mbox/#{LISTNAME}.mbox.old
C) run '~mailman/mhonarc/archive.pl --listname #{LISTNAME}
~mailman/archives/private/#{LISTNAME}.mbox/#{LISTNAME}.mbox.old'
